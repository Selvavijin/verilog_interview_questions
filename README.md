'&' in VHDL acts as a contatenation operator.

In unary operator(&), if any one bit is zero, then the output is zero. Output is 1, only if all the bits are 1.

'~' in verilog is a unary not operator. Whereas '!' acts as a logical NOT operator and the output will be 1 bit.

'~A' in verilog = 'not A' in vhdl

In vhdl, 'not' is used for both the bitwise not and logical not operation. How?, if we use the 'not' in any assignment statement, it will acts as a bitwise 'not'. If we use 'not' in conditional statements, it will acts like logical 'not'.
